    	<h2>Weekly Assignment 2</h2>
    	<h3>Due 9/14 at 4:00pm</h3>

        <p>We will continue to 'scrape' data from <a target="_blank" href='http://www.nyintergroup.org/meetinglist/'>http://www.nyintergroup.org/meetinglist/</a></p>

    		<ol>
		<li>Using Node.js, read the text file that you wrote for last week's assignment. Store the contents of the file in a variable.</li>
        <li>Ask yourself, "why are we reading this from a saved text file instead of making another request?"</li>
<li>Last week, you studied the HTML structure of this file and began to think about how you might parse it to extract the relevant data for each meeting. Using this knowledge about its structure, write a program in Node.js that will print to the console the street address for <em>every</em> meeting in your text file.</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href='https://github.com/visualizedata/data-structures/blob/master/starter-code/week02.js'>Starter Code</a></li>
<li>Update your GitHub repository with the relevant file(s) </li>
<li>Submit the relevant file(s) to Canvas</li>
<li>Submit to Canvas the URL for your GitHub repository</li>
